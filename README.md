This repository contains the raw data and the analysys in week 8 experiment.
And using reveal.js presentation framwork as the presentation page at github pages.

## Experiments

- RC phase shift
- RL phase shift
- RLC driven damped oscillation
- RLC band-pass fillter (resonance freq , phase shift)
- Sound filtering


## Folder struc 

All folders contains the raw data from oscilloscope.

All the resource that github pages uses are in the root folder 
(It is very messy but I got no time to clean it up)

If you are interesting at the experiment method and the data analysing in our experiment
You can take a look at file with suffix .ipynb . (not contain test.ipynb,it is just for testing purpose)
