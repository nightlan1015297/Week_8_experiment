# Week 8 Review

This repository contains the raw data and the analysys in week 8 experiment.
And using reveal.js presentation framwork as the presentation page at github pages.

## Experiments

- RC phase shift
- RL phase shift
- RLC driven damped oscillation
- RLC band-pass fillter (resonance freq , phase shift)
- Sound filtering

If you are interesting at the experiment method and the data analysing in our experiment
You can take a look at file in ./root with suffix .ipynb . 
(not contain test.ipynb,it is just for testing purpose)
